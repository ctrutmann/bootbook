# BootBook
BootBook is a private social network for [**Dev Bootcamp**]('http://devbootcamp.com/') students and graduates, built to help boots connect across cohorts and campuses.

Filters make it easier to find mentors or collaborators with similar interests, while optional mentor/collab conversation buttons only show on a boot's profile if they have indicated that they are open to mentoring or collaborating. This alleviates much of the awkwardness of cold-contacting someone, while shielding boots from unwanted requests. Plain direct messaging is possible with each boot.

The Dev Bootcamp experience and culture uniquely prepares us to learn intensively, be emotionally intelligent in teams, and '*make beautiful, meaningful things*.' At the same time, getting through Dev Bootcamp and transitioning into the tech industry as a bootcamp grad are unique challenges. **BootBook** aims to leverage our strengths and reduce our anxieties by connecting us to fellow boots at every stage: from Phase 0 to professional web developer.

### Contributing
BootBook started as a final project of the 2016 San Francisco Nighthawks, but we hope to make it a friendly open source project that many current and future boots will contribute to.
